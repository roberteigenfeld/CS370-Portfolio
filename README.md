# Pirate Intelligent Agent - CS 370 Project

## Project Summary

For this project, I worked on building an intelligent agent to solve a treasure hunt problem using reinforcement learning. I was given a base environment and game setup. I created the deep Q-learning model myself, along with the training loop, state-action mappings, and performance tracking. The goal was to train the pirate agent to find the treasure using the shortest and most efficient path possible. My notebook shows how the agent learned through trial and error to improve its decisions over time.

## Reflection

Throughout this course, I learned how reinforcement learning connects with real-world problem solving in computer science. I used neural networks to help the agent learn from experience, and I gained hands-on practice with concepts like Q-tables, exploration vs. exploitation, and reward-based training.

Computer scientists solve complex problems using logic, data, and systems thinking. They create solutions that affect people’s lives, so their work matters in nearly every field—from healthcare and security to education and entertainment. In this project, I acted like a computer scientist by breaking the problem into smaller parts, experimenting with different model setups, and adjusting the system based on feedback from the agent’s behavior.

Ethically, I’ve learned that it’s important to make systems that are fair, transparent, and aligned with the goals of both users and organizations. AI developers, in particular, must be careful that learning agents do not make biased or harmful decisions, especially when used in real-world applications. This project gave me a deeper appreciation for the responsibility that comes with building intelligent systems.
