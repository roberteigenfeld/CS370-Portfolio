# Pirate Intelligent Agent CS 370 Project

## Project Summary

For this project, I created an intelligent agent that solves a treasure hunt problem using reinforcement learning. I was given the basic environment and game setup, including the state grid and reward system. I wrote the deep Q-learning model myself, including the neural network, training loop, action selection process, and performance tracking. The goal was to help the agent learn how to reach the treasure more efficiently with each training episode.

## Reflection

This project helped me understand how reinforcement learning works in a real problem. I used concepts like Q-values, rewards, and policy updates to train the agent. I saw how an agent can improve its decisions by learning from experience and trial and error.

Computer scientists solve problems by building systems and writing code that works in the real world. Their work is important because it powers things we use every day, like apps, websites, and smart devices. In this project, I worked like a computer scientist by breaking the problem into parts, building working solutions, testing them, and improving them over time.

I also learned about the responsibility developers have when creating intelligent systems. Even a small learning agent needs to be designed carefully so it works as intended. As AI becomes more common, developers must think about fairness and user impact. This project helped me understand how to design systems that are not only effective but also responsible and clear in how they work.
