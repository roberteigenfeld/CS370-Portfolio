# Pirate Intelligent Agent — CS 370 Project

## Project Summary

For this project, I developed an intelligent agent to solve a treasure hunt problem using reinforcement learning. I was given the base environment and game structure — including the reward system and state grid. I created the deep Q-learning model from scratch, including the neural network, training loop, action selection logic, and performance evaluation. The agent learned how to navigate the environment and reach the goal more efficiently over time through exploration and feedback.

## Reflection

This project helped me understand how reinforcement learning applies to real-world problem-solving — especially in building systems that improve through experience. I used concepts like Q-values, reward signals, and policy optimization to train the agent, and I saw firsthand how learning algorithms adjust behavior based on trial and error.

Computer scientists design systems, solve problems, and build technologies that impact nearly every part of society. Their work matters because it drives innovation — from apps and automation to artificial intelligence and cybersecurity. In this project, I applied a computer scientist’s mindset by analyzing the problem, building modular code, testing hypotheses, and refining my model based on results.

Ethically, I’ve learned that developers carry responsibility for how their systems behave and affect others. Intelligent agents — even in simple environments like this — must be built with care to avoid bias or unintended consequences. As AI becomes more common in the real world, this responsibility only grows. This project reminded me that good design is not just about performance — it’s also about fairness, transparency, and accountability.
